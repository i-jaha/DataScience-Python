# Data Science Course Homework

## Overview
This repository contains my homework assignments for a Data Science course focused on Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization. The course covers essential topics such as Python fundamentals, data structures, numerical computing with NumPy, data analysis with Pandas, regular expressions, and data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Each assignment is completed as part of practical case studies to apply the learned concepts.
